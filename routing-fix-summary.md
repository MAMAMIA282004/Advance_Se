# Routing Fix Summary

## Issue Description
```
hook.js:608 404 Error: User attempted to access non-existent route: /user-dashboard Error Component Stack
    at NotFound (NotFound.tsx:9:20)
```

## Root Cause
There was a mismatch between the routes defined in `App.tsx` and the paths used throughout the application:

### Routes in App.tsx (Before Fix)
```tsx
<Route path="/dashboard/user" element={<UserDashboard />} />
<Route path="/dashboard/charity" element={<CharityDashboard />} />
<Route path="/dashboard/admin" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
```

### Paths Used in Application Code
- `utils.ts` GetDashboardPath(): `/user-dashboard`, `/charity-dashboard`, `/admin-dashboard`
- `Header.tsx` navigation links: `/user-dashboard`

## Fix Applied

### Updated App.tsx Routes
```tsx
// BEFORE (Problematic)
<Route path="/dashboard/user" element={<UserDashboard />} />
<Route path="/dashboard/charity" element={<CharityDashboard />} />
<Route path="/dashboard/admin" element={<AdminDashboard />} />

// AFTER (Fixed)
<Route path="/user-dashboard" element={<UserDashboard />} />
<Route path="/charity-dashboard" element={<CharityDashboard />} />
<Route path="/admin-dashboard" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
```

## Files Affected
1. **App.tsx**: Updated route definitions to match application usage
2. **utils.ts**: Already had correct paths - no changes needed
3. **Header.tsx**: Already had correct paths - no changes needed

## Result
- ✅ Routes now match the paths used in navigation
- ✅ `/user-dashboard` route now works correctly
- ✅ `/charity-dashboard` and `/admin-dashboard` routes also fixed
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ No more 404 errors when accessing dashboard routes

## Key Principle
Ensure consistency between:
1. Route definitions in the router configuration
2. Navigation paths used in links and programmatic navigation
3. Redirect paths returned by utility functions

The fix ensures that users can successfully navigate to their appropriate dashboards without encountering 404 errors.
